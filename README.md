## Features
-   **B+ Tree Storage Engine with Indexing Support**: Enables fast data retrieval, which is critical for database performance, especially in scenarios involving large datasets.

-   **Free List Management for Node Reuse**: The database manages a free list to reuse nodes, which is a strategy to optimize storage usage by recycling space from freed nodes. This helps reduce fragmentation and improve disk space efficiency.

-   **Transaction Support**: AtomixDB supports transactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity through atomic operations.
-   **Concurrent Reads**: The ability to handle concurrent reads enhances performance by allowing multiple users to read data simultaneously without locking issues, making it suitable for read-heavy applications.




## Upcoming Features

-   **Query Processing**: Enhancing AtomixDB with query capabilities to support more complex data retrieval and manipulation.
